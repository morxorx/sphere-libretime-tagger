# ✅ LibreTime MP3 Tagger

As simple-as-possible GUI to tag and rename mp3 files according to [Sphere Radio](sphere-radio.net) LibreTime tagging scheme.

The tool lets the user enter the relevant information, which is then saved in ID3 tags.

Cover art is converted to 1400×1400p JPG format to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

## How To Use This Thing That Should Be Operable by a Monkey?

### Fields

- **Select MP3 File:** 
Self-explanatory

- **Contributors:** 
Enter hosts, DJs, or other important contributors here. Multiple contributors should be comma-separated (e.g., "DJ A, DJ B"). The field is optional but highly recommended.

- **Show Name:** 
Self-explanatory

- **Episode Number:** 
The number of your episode. Expects a numeric value, so "CINCO" is not allowed. Field is optional but highly recommended.

- **Episode Title:** 
Optional title of your episode. Not for descriptions.

- **Broadcast Date:** 
Single number per field.

- **Cover Art:** 
Optional field but nice-to-have. Accepts `.PNG` and `.JPG`.

### Buttons

- **Preview:** 
Gives a preview of how the file will be named, etc. (see second screenshot).

- **Save:** 
Saves, obviously. Saving overwrites the information of the original file.

- **Clear:** 
Clears all fields at once.
