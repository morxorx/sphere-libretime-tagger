# ✅ LibreTime MP3 Tagger

As simple-as-possible GUI to tag and rename `.mp3` files according to [Sphere Radio](sphere-radio.net) LibreTime tagging scheme.

The tool lets the user enter the relevant information, which is then saved in ID3 tags.

Cover art is converted to 1400×1400p JPEG format to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

## How to Install?

The App is **unsigned** which means that both macOS and Windows will warn the user about potential security risks. You can ignore these.

However, on macOS you must go extra steps to be able to install the tagger:

**1. Download the App**

Find your version under [releases](https://github.com/morxorx/sphere-libretime-tagger/releases). `.dmg`and .app.zip`for macOS, `.exe` for Windows.
